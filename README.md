## Waiting for an answer?
Superlayer is build by just one human being — that’s me, [Martin](https://twitter.com/martinlexow)! I’ll try my very best to make this app a terrific experience for you. I promise to read every incoming email and issue. Unfortunately, due to lack of time, I may do not respond in every case. Please bear with me and stay kind.
